# If It Wasn't For You
## A small game written, drawn, and programmed by high school seniors.
If It Wasn't For You is being built on a homemande 2D Java engine utilizing Swing and Awt. The repository will be moved to private
once an actual game is being made. But for now it'll stay public since it's all just engine code right now.
### Features

- Easily creatable objects through use of compartmentalized scripts
  - Audio, Collision, Animation, etc
